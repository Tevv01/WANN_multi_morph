# Weight Agnostic Neural Networks on changing morphologies


This code is extended off of ['Weight Agnostic Neural Networks'](https://weightagnostic.github.io/) by Adam Gaier and David Ha, and built to run expirements for my masters thesis at UiO to study how WANN respond to changing morphologies.
This is done using [Evogym](https://github.com/EvolutionGym/evogym) for environment and random generation of morphologies.
